# aws-web-app-autoscaling

I used Terraform instead of using Amazon Web Services GUI create a VPC, instances, security groups, aka all the infrastrusture.

So, rather than repeating infrastucture and manually terminating it through the GUI, it all can be done through my IDE with Terraform configuration files.
